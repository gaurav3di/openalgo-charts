// Go to a date or a range on the selected chart.
//
// The navigation rules (which bar a date names, when history is short, how a
// newer request or a destroyed chart ends one) are the widget tier's
// DateNavigator, shared with the packaged widget. What is this page's own is
// how missing history arrives: the reference feed serves history by period
// rather than by page, so older bars come from the shortest longer period
// that reaches the requested time, loaded through the pane's ordinary load
// path. The range menu then shows the period that was actually loaded, which
// is the honest record of it.
//
// That load rebuilds the pane's chart, and the panel goes with the chart's
// overlays. The request itself carries on, so the panel is opened again on
// the new chart to show it through: a result short of a placement (history
// that starts later, no bars, a failed load) is reported where it was asked.
// A pan or zoom while the period loads drops the request instead, as the
// packaged widget does: the user has moved on, and a placement would undo it.
// That watch is the page's too, since only the page knows which view moves
// are its own.
